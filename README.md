# React + Vite

I created this app using React and Vite, optimized for the fastest development experience for future projects. It can also be used as a default template for anyone.
Here are some packages that have been added â€“ check below.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
